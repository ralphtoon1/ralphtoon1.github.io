                <h4>Objectives:</h4>
                <p>I participated in the 2022 Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) open category with a
                    team of nine fellow researchers. Our primary objective was to design and program a swarm of 25
                    drones capable of autonomously navigating an unfamiliar 40mx20m obstacle course under low light
                    conditions. Teleoperation of the drones was prohibited, and we had a strict time limit of only 10
                    minutes for setup before the drones had to attempt the course. The competition's evaluation was
                    based on the number of drones that successfully completed the course by navigating all the
                    obstacles.
                </p>
                <h4>Techincal:</h4>
                <p>After careful consideration, we selected the Crazyflie 2.1 drone platform for our project. I had
                    prior experience with swarm programming using this platform, and it provided us with various options
                    for easily incorporating localization capabilities into the drones.
                    Our team's approach to completing the course involved mapping the environment during the setup phase
                    of the competition. We employed a Clearpath Husky UGV equipped with a Velodyne LIDAR to generate a
                    3D representation of the course using Hector SLAM and Octomap. From this map, we derived a flight
                    trajectory that could be converted into waypoints for the drone swarm. To control the swarm, we
                    utilized the Crazyswarm package in ROS, which allowed us to transmit the waypoints to all drones
                    simultaneously, ensuring cohesive movement.
                    My responsibilities encompassed the programming of the drone swarm, as well as the selection and
                    evaluation of the localization method. We opted for an ultra-wideband radio system (UWB) for
                    localization due to its extended range. This approach enabled us to use a small number of radio tags
                    during setup, expediting the process, while also ensuring that most tags remained detectable by the
                    drones throughout, thereby enhancing localization accuracy. Additionally, we incorporated a height
                    and optical flow sensor to improve hover stability. Preliminary testing on a simulated 20mx10m
                    course demonstrated the system's ability to successfully locate all drones, thereby facilitating
                    successful navigation.

                </p>
                <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
                <p>Despite our solution performing well during testing prior to the competition, the UWB system
                    unexpectedly encountered radio interference from the competition venue. Consequently, the drone's
                    localization system failed, preventing the swarm from taking off or flying with stability. While
                    this outcome was disappointing, our system still received recognition through a judge's commendation
                    award, which acknowledged its stability and performance during testing. We gained valuable insights
                    into the importance of stability and the fragility of localization systems, which we can utilize in
                    future endeavours to create more robust systems with enhanced redundancy.
