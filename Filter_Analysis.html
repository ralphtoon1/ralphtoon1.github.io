                <h4>Objectives:</h4>
                <p>
                    During my placement year at a fuel filter engineering company, I was entrusted with the development
                    of software for a filter analysis test system. The primary objective was to create a robust and
                    accurate data logging software to assess the lifetime of prototype filters using real-world fuel. As
                    the system was deployed offsite, it needed to be accessible remotely by engineers and capable of
                    running autonomously for extended periods without supervision. Given that the hardware for the
                    project had already been selected, my tasks involved familiarizing myself with the test system,
                    acquiring LabVIEW programming skills, and delivering user-friendly data logging software.
                </p>

                <h4>Technical:</h4>
                <p>
                    The system's data logging hardware and gauges had been preselected and included two NI USB-6001 USB
                    DAQs. These DAQs were connected to pressure, flow, particle count, and fluid temperature sensors,
                    with an industrial touchscreen PC utilized to run the LabVIEW software. For remote access, a 4G
                    modem facilitated continuous control of the PC through TeamViewer remote desktop.
                    LabVIEW was chosen as the development platform for the data logging software due to its proven
                    reliability in accurate lab data acquisition, and its graphical nature, which enhanced readability
                    for engineers unfamiliar with programming. The software not only processed and displayed the sensor
                    measurements but also periodically appended data to an Excel file, generated real-time graphs for
                    easier data analysis, and saved images of the graphs for immediate use in internal presentations. To
                    enhance maintainability, sub-VIs were employed extensively to encapsulate specific features such as
                    graph generation and derived data calculations.

                </p>

                <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
                <p>
                    The software was successfully developed and deployed to the offsite test rig, where it has been
                    running continuously since its deployment in 2020. Engineers utilize the software daily to monitor
                    test progress, log data for reports, and extract insights. The system has proven to be robust and
                    capable of recovering and returning to logging after power outages, ensuring no data loss occurs.
                    The software's reliability and usability have contributed to the smooth operation of the test rig,
                    providing valuable data for analysis and reporting purposes.
