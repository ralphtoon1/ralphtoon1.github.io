                    Ralph, and I'm delighted to have you here. Allow me to introduce myself.

                <p>
                    I’m a 25-year-old robotics engineer with passion for designing dependable intelligent machines that
                    leverage technology to further efficiency. During 4 years of experience in the field, including 2
                    years of research in Singapore, I've grabbed every opportunity I can to explore many facets
                    including manufacturing, UAVs/UGVs, legged robots, and automotive engineering. I graduated from the
                    University of Leeds with a Master’s in Mechatronics and Robotics in 2021, and throughout my journey,
                    I've been driven by relentless curiosity and a mission to create reliable and accurate working
                    partners in every aspect of life. I believe in the transformative power of robotics and its
                    potential to reshape industries and improve lives, allowing people to focus on the more creative and
                    fulfilling aspects of design, engineering, and everyday life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my time in Singapore, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to work on novel aerial robotics
                    alongside experienced researchers and engineers at the Singapore University of Technology and
                    Design. This broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of the field, allowing me explore
                    drone swarming, SLAM, and robot-robot collaboration. It exposed me to diverse perspectives and
                    approaches, fostering a global mindset that continues to shape my work today. What sets me apart is
                    my constant enthusiasm for learning new technologies, which can be seen through the broad array of
                    projects and roles I showcase here. By combining my technical expertise with a deep understanding of
                    human-machine interaction, I strive to develop robots that are not only functional but also robust
                    and intuitive for other engineers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of robotics, you can find me maintaining my project car,
                    indulging in the exhilarating world of sim racing, or following McLaren in Formula 1. These hobbies
                    provide me with a much-needed balance and allow me to explore my creativity outside of my
                    professional pursuits. I find that they fuel my problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to
                    think on my feet and adapt to dynamic situations.
                </p>
