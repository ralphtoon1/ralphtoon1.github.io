                <h3>Objectives:</h3>
                <p>Our objective was to demonstrate to an automotive engineering partner the effectiveness of our
                    prototyped automation upgrades for their manual manufacturing processes. As a collaborative effort
                    among four members, our MEng project involved analysing the partner's current manufacturing process
                    and designing, prototyping, and benchmarking an automated replacement. In addition to this primary
                    goal, we aimed to showcase the advantages of automation to the partner and provide a blueprint for
                    future manufacturing upgrades. The manufacturing process we focused on involved depalletizing metal
                    parts, applying liquid sealant and a rubber seal, and ejecting the finished part onto a conveyor.
                </p>

                <h3>Techincal:</h3>
                <p>To meet the partner's design specifications for cycle time, safety, and complexity, we collectively
                    developed process concept designs, which were then reviewed and approved by the partner. As per
                    their request, we integrated their existing manual sealant application machine into the workcell
                    design. For depalletizing and seal application tasks, we selected Universal Robots UR10e and UR3e,
                    respectively, and upgraded the manual machine to interface seamlessly with these robotic arms. My
                    responsibilities within the project encompassed electrical analysis, design, and robotic arm
                    programming.
                    Initially, I thoroughly analysed the electrical systems of the manual process and subsequently
                    reengineered them to ensure compatibility with Universal Robots' UR10e Cobot arm. To maintain
                    consistency with the original machine's documentation, I meticulously created electrical schematics
                    using AutoCAD Electrical. Additionally, I developed a replacement PLC program for the manual
                    machine, enabling it to be triggered from the cobot's controller instead of relying on its human
                    interface.
                    Utilizing Polyscope, I programmed all Cobots, starting with the depalletizing operation. This
                    involved implementing four box-pick operations to remove parts identified with a 2.5D vision system,
                    followed by the removal of the box to a spare pallet. We trained the vision system to accommodate
                    variations in part placement and thoroughly assessed vision performance under different lighting
                    conditions to simulate the factory environment. Subsequently, we programmed the rubber seal
                    application, leveraging computer vision to detect parts and determine optimal placement locations,
                    while also accounting for placement variability. Finally, we conducted comprehensive analysis of
                    process cycle times at varying joint speeds and accelerations to meet the desired specifications.

                </p>
                <h3>Outcomes:</h3>
                <p>Collectively, our team successfully validated each aspect of the work cell in isolation, including
                    depalletizing, seal application, and sealant application. We substantiated the benefits of
                    automation to the partner by presenting them with cycle time data and return on investment
                    calculations. However, due to COVID-related supply chain restrictions, we faced delays in procuring
                    the Cobots, which impeded full-scale testing and deployment of the complete cell within the allotted
                    timeframe of our degrees. Nevertheless, we delivered comprehensive designs to the partner, which
                    were utilized by on-site engineers to complete the project's deployment.</p>
