                <h3>Objectives:</h3>
                <p>
                    For my BEng final project, I undertook the task of enhancing an existing hexapod robot frame by
                    designing the necessary electronics and software for precise movement control. The objective was to
                    create a versatile hexapod that could be utilized in advanced legged robot research projects. To
                    achieve this, a well-documented API was developed, enabling users with limited knowledge of hexapod
                    kinematics and dynamics to control the frame through basic functions.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical:</h3>
                <p>
                    The project comprised two main components: electronics design and hexapod controller programming.
                    The electronics design phase took precedence, involving the creation of a PCB using Autodesk EAGLE.
                    The PCB was designed to handle power distribution, facilitate control of 32 servos via I2C, and
                    serve as a carrier board for the LPC1768 microcontroller. Surface mount components and a
                    double-sided layout were employed to minimize the PCB's size, ensuring it would fit within the
                    hexapod frame. Furthermore, the inclusion of a full cover ground plane aided in heat dissipation
                    from the power delivery components.
                    Subsequently, the hexapod's controller was designed and programmed. Kinematic analysis of the legs
                    yielded joint equations for each leg, ensuring accurate foot placement. Trajectory equations were
                    then generated to determine the foot's path during a step, resulting in 3rd order polynomial
                    trajectories. This compromise was necessary due to the limited computing power of the
                    microcontroller; 5th order trajectories generally offer smoother movement but would pose complexity
                    challenges during runtime on the microcontroller. MATLAB was employed to analyse the equations,
                    allowing for visualization of the cartesian positions of the foot with varying step lengths and
                    heights. Additionally, this analysis confirmed that the kinematic equations could successfully
                    achieve the desired positions.
                    The controller was programmed in C++, utilizing Arm's mbed OS to expedite development. Emphasis was
                    placed on developing fewer features to produce well-documented and efficient code, thereby reducing
                    any potential issues for future users of the platform. A modular design approach was adopted,
                    featuring self-contained classes that facilitated the reusability of project modules, such as the
                    servo controller.

                </p>

                <h3>Outcomes:</h3>
                <p>
                    The project successfully resulted in a fully functional hexapod platform capable of performing
                    translational movement in all directions, as well as sitting and standing motions. Additionally,
                    comprehensive documentation and a PC-based remote control application were developed, enabling
                    effective demonstration of the project to peers and academics during project showcases.
                </p>
